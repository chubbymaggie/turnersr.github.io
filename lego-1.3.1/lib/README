Information for Lego Library directory
=======================================

/usr/lib/lego or /usr/local/lib/lego

The directories lib_TYPE and lib_Type are automatically generated from
the files in the libs directory.

lib_Prop isn't automatically generated.

The libs directory is obsolete and may be removed in a future release.
You should import modules only from the directories lib_Prop,
lib_TYPE or lib_Type.
Please send a mail to lego@dcs.ed.ac.uk if this is a problem.
