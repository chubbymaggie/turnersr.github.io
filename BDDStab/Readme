SETUP

BDDStab is an abstract domain for the binary analysis framework Jakstab [1].
Therefore, the source code of Jakstab is required to run it.
The provided patch has been tested with changeset dde24eb1ac03 (v0.8.3) from [2].
Furthermore, parts of BDDStab are written in Scala [3], which necessitates
the corresponding scala-library.jar.
We tested BDDStab with the scala-library.jar as bundled with the 2.10.3 release.
Note that the bdd.jar contains the source code, sbt configuration, and eclipse
project files necessary to build it. To access the source code, simply rename
bdd.jar to bdd.zip and unzip the archive.
