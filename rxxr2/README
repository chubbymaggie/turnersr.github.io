Building requires: ocamllex, ocamlyacc, ocamlc. Execute the build script: ./build.sh

This should produce an executable named scan.bin inside the source directory.

Testing
File mode:

./scan.bin -i <input_file>
Each line on the file is interpreted as a pattern of the form /REGEX/MODS. Empty lines and lines beginning with a # symbol are ignored. Most common pattern syntaxes are supported (Java, PCRE etc.).

Interractive mode:

./scan.bin
Then enter patterns into the terminal (NOTE:- in this mode, the analyser performs an exhaustive search).
